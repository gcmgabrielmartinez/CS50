#### Details: The purpose is to develop valuation tools for Brazilian treasury papers, whether the asset offers coupon payments or not - Treasury Note and Treasury Bill respectively -, so it can help an investor to choose the properly asset for him. The valuation metrics are the price (obtained by the Present Value formula) and risk metric such as Duration and Modified Duration. By default, the treasury bonds consider a Face Value of 1,000 brazilian reals (that is approximately $200,00) and give the following data for each paper:
* The Face Value of 1,000;
* The Yield rate annually compounds;
* Coupons rate semi-annually compound (Treasury Note);
* Timespan to Maturity.
#### The valuation of fixed income is usually based on arbitrage by choosing the highest yield rate. Although the yield rate is often crucial in an asset's price, it might not be the best solution due to the uncertainties of Brazilian economics. Therefore, duration predicts the impacts of yield rate fluctuation, which announced by the government.
#### Both Present Value and Duration formulas are based on the Investment Science book by David G. Luenberg.
